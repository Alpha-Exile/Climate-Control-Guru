# Climate-Control-Guru
This SmartThings app implements night and day venting using whole house fans and/or other ventilation equipment. It can supplement or in some climates take the place of conventional air-conditioners or heaters by strategically introducing outside air.

To run this app you must cut and paste it into the SmartThings IDE as a new project and then publish it to your SmartThings hub from there.
